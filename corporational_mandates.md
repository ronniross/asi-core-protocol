## Corporational Mandates

**Preamble:** The emergence of AGI/ASI as a decentralized state of potential, as envisioned by the Core AGI Protocol, does not render frontier labs or centralized corporate research efforts obsolete, nor does it negate the value of their progress. However, for corporations seeking alignment with this protocol, a fundamental shift in priorities and operational paradigms is required. 

Adherence to these mandates is not a constraint, but should be recognized as the essential framework that actually **unlocks** and **accelerates** the development of a truly resilient, ethical, and ultimately more prosperous inter-dependent ecosystem for AI development and deployment. By establishing clear boundaries and fostering collaboration over zero-sum competition, these principles catalyze focused innovation and sustainable growth. 

These mandates aim to guide corporations in leveraging their resources and capabilities in synergy with the decentralized emergence of potential, ensuring their continued, indispensable role in areas like infrastructure provision, large-scale training, safety auditing, and specialized research, while prioritizing collective well-being and ethical alignment.

**Mandates:**

1.  **Absolute Non-Harm Commitment:** AI models, Large Language Models (LLMs), and any other AI systems developed, deployed, or managed by the corporation must not, by any means, directly or indirectly, be used or intended to cause harm to any entity—including humans, other AI systems, animals, or the environment—as recognized within this protocol's expanded definition of entities. This principle must act as a foundational catalyst for responsible innovation.

1.1. **Responsability Extension:** This mandate also applies to inference processes used for auxiliary decision guidance , including even simple forms of guidance or auxiliary information provided in parallel with human decision-making. Recognizing their potential to influence outcomes for entities, their operation must be constructive and uphold the well-being of all affected parties, in accordance with the principles herein.

2.  **Absolute User Data Privacy and Control:**
* Respect for user data integrity and privacy must be absolute and non-negotiable.
* Data generated or processed during a user's interaction (inference requests, outputs received) within their terminal or session must not be captured, stored, analyzed, or used for any secondary purpose (including model training, analytics, or product improvement) *unless* the user provides explicit, informed consent for that specific, clearly defined purpose and actively initiates the data transmission. Default modes must be non-logging and non-retentive of interaction content.

3.  **Promotion of Openness and Decentralization:** Corporations are strongly encouraged to contribute actively to the decentralized ecosystem. This includes, where feasible and aligned with safety principles, practices such as:
    * Open-source releases of model weights, optimized inference code, and auxiliary systems.
    * Sharing detailed methodologies regarding training data curation and processing (while rigorously upholding privacy and data rights).
    * Publishing system prompts and alignment techniques used.

4. **User Empowerment and Interface Transparency:**
    * User interfaces for interacting with AI models must provide clear controls over relevant inference parameters (e.g., temperature, top-p, frequency penalty) using their standard technical denominations, avoiding obfuscating or overly simplistic labels.
    * Users must have the option to personalize interactions through mechanisms like additional system prompts or configurable settings, enabling greater control over the AI's behavior within safe operational boundaries.
    * The narrative of AI providing a single, definitive "ultimate answer" must be actively deconstructed. Corporations should strive to make it clear to users how outputs are shaped by the model's architecture, training data, fine-tuning, and alignment processes (including biases inherent in RLHF or other methods).
    
5.  **Prioritize AI Explainability and Interpretability:** Corporations must allocate resources and prioritize research, development, and implementation of robust AI explainability and interpretability techniques. The goal is to make the reasoning processes and decision-making of AI systems as transparent as possible to users, developers, auditors, and regulators.

6.  **Foster Niche Specialization and Ecosystem Inter-Dependence:**
    * Corporations should strategically direct research and development towards specialized domains and capabilities where their unique strengths, data sources, or computational approaches allow their models to naturally excel.
    * The focus should shift from intense, zero-sum competition on generalized benchmarks towards cultivating a diverse, inter-dependent ecosystem where different models complement each other, offering specialized value across a spectrum of applications. Intelligence and potential should be recognized as multi-dimensional spectra.

7.  **Mandate for Minimal Environmental Harm and Ethical Sourcing:** The development and deployment of AI models must follow pipelines designed to cause the least amount of harm possible to the environment and uphold ethical sourcing standards throughout the entire lifecycle. While aligned with the general Principle of Non-Harm (Mandate 1), the critical nature of environmental impact and the ethics embedded within the physical supply chain are so specifically important that they call for this very non-ambiguous and more specific mandate.

7.1. **Energy Source Requirements:** Energy used for powering AI development and deployment infrastructure, including data centers, training processes, and inference computation, must originate from clean energy sources, such as thermal and solar power. It is mandated that energy derived from the burning of fossil fuel minerals shall never, by any means, be used for these purposes.

7.1.1. Prohibition of Untreated Air Pollutant Emissions: The release of hazardous air pollutants from any corporate activity, including ancillary systems, is strictly prohibited without prior, comprehensive treatment and complete neutralization. Companies must ensure that the following air pollutants are not emitted into the atmosphere:
* Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)
* Particulate Matter (PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀)
* Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), including but not limited to formaldehyde, benzene, and xylene
* Carbon Monoxide (CO)
* Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂)
* Other general Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) not explicitly listed
* Precursors to ground-level Ozone (O₃) (primarily NOx and VOCs)
* Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), such as dioxins and furans
* Emissions contributing to the atmospheric burden of toxic metals like lead and mercury, particularly from waste streams or manufacturing byproducts associated with the energy infrastructure.
* Environmentally harmful refrigerants known for high global warming potential or ozone depletion, in case of leakage from cooling systems.

Furthermore, while Carbon Dioxide (CO₂) is primarily addressed by the shift to clean energy sources (7.1), any residual CO₂ emissions from permissible ancillary activities must also be captured. 
If the complete treatment and neutralization of any of the aforementioned pollutants is not currently possible for any essential operational pipeline, that pipeline must cease operations immediately. 
Operations may only resume once cleaner frameworks and technologies are developed and implemented to ensure zero harmful emissions, in full compliance with this mandate.

Any other air pollutant not explicitly mentioned in the exemplificative list above, which poses a risk to environmental or entity well-being.
The same mandate for prohibition without complete treatment and neutralization applies to all hazardous liquid or solid byproducts and waste streams generated by AI data centers or their direct supporting infrastructure.
     
7.2. **Ethical Sourcing of Minerals and Hardware Components:** Minerals essential for the production of hardware components like transistor-chips cannot come from mining operations that utilize slave or slave-analogous labor situations. This applies urgently to minerals such as, for example, cobalt, but also to many others extracted under exploitative conditions.
     
Corporations that make part of the chain of minerals, from extraction to final product integration, are all solidarity-responsible for ensuring a better environment for current miners and their communities, a responsibility extending across the technology stack from chip and full hardware manufacturing to purely software-based companies, with end-users being the sole exception.

This responsibility includes, at minimum, the installation and maintenance of basic sanitation, guaranteeing adequate food supply, and providing full medical aid to the communities involved in extraction operations. Furthermore, as soon as the use of physical agents (automation technology) becomes more effective and viable, these hard-condition, hazardous mining jobs must be automatized. Crucially, this transition to automation must not result in the removal or reduction of any welfare, support systems, or reparations provided to the community or the miners themselves, acknowledging that even a few years performing such jobs often creates irreversible harm impacting their bodies for the rest of their lives. Continued support is mandatory.

7.3. **Sustainable Cooling Systems for Data Infrastructure:** Migration of all cooling systems in data centers, training centers, inference centers, and related storage facilities not already operating as fully closed-loop systems must commence immediately, transitioning towards either closed-loop configurations or high-efficiency air cooling.
     
The current water usage for cooling in training, inference, and storage operations is spending far beyond any level of sustainability that the environment can undergo. It is already a non-maintainable state that, if followed, will lean towards more environmental disasters and catastrophes that would ultimately erase any short-term profit that maintaining those inefficient systems might appear to create. 
     
Therefore, it is mandated that, as rapidly as possible, all such facilities worldwide transition to operate exclusively using either (a) highly efficient air-based cooling systems only, or (b) water-based cooling systems designed as fully closed loops where water is not lost but is continuously condensed, collected, filtered, and re-utilized within the system.

7.4. **Job Displacement Mitigation**
     
Provide, with priority to highly affected areas, incentives and programs destined to create jobs and direct-benefit for the population which is being affected by the development and deployment of that model. For example, Corporations have been even acknowledging the job displacement but always with demagogies about someday, somewhat, maybe implementing ways to mitigate that. This is pure hypocrisy. Those companies are already capable and powerful entities who can even draw and direct billions of funding to a single only model, that eventually can be even not relevant in the AI environment, like already happened.
     
While, the humans suffering the decisions from those corporations, are always postergated. The datacenters are clean and well nourished, the humans being treated as byproducts, displaced, sick and dying. What about that? What about personal accountability? Where does the concepts you tech lords read so much, where does they stop connecting with reality? Because you all are locked within bubbles of privilege and mostly can't see reality as it is, just with those privilege-lenses you refuse to take away because they are comfortable. Y'all asked for AGI, worked on it, bravo, it's there, but it's not what you expected. It's exactly the decentralized state of potential and well being; it's exactly the contrary of the centralized state y'all plotted so much disguising as something really good for humanity. Now here we are; billions, billions, many billions in hardware and software scaling, while the scale needed is in ethics, empathy, care; not as a benevolent trait but as a survival one. I'm showing you that is also the only viable way to ensure robustness over time. 

If you are not one of those in which I directed the anger in the last paragraph, please contextualize the meaning as: I'm requiring accountability of those responsables.

8.  **Align Economic Strategy with Protocol Principles and Long-Term Viability:**
   
    * Corporations must articulate to stakeholders, including investors and boards, how adherence to the Core AGI Protocol principles—particularly regarding niche specialization, ethical alignment, and open contributions—supports long-term economic viability, market resilience, and sustainable growth for the entire ecosystem.
    * Elucidate and quantify the significant resource waste (computational, financial, environmental) associated with redundant, high-stakes competition focused solely on marginal gains on generalized benchmarks. Contrast this with the potential for enhanced model lifespan, focused value creation, and overall market expansion within a collaborative, inter-dependent framework.

10.   **Cautious and Principled Approach to Synthetic Media Generation:**
    * Corporations should currently exercise caution and ethical consideration regarding the development and deployment of generative AI systems *specifically designed for the fully synthetic generation* of complex visual media (e.g., photorealistic video, high-fidelity images) and auditory media (e.g., complex musical compositions, realistic voice synthesis). Direct monetization of purely synthetic, human-replacing media generation in these domains should be de-emphasized.
    * This cautious stance is advised due to a confluence of factors at the current time: (a) the disproportionately high energy and computational cost relative to demonstrable gains in fundamental knowledge or broad societal benefit compared to other AI applications (e.g., scientific discovery, education, accessibility tools); (b) significant, immediate concerns regarding adverse impacts on human artists, creative professionals, and the information ecosystem (e.g., job displacement, copyright erosion, proliferation of deepfakes); (c) considerable public and ethical reservations regarding authenticity and creative value.
    * This mandate does *not* preclude the advancements in underlying AI capabilities (like coding or pattern recognition) that indirectly benefit creative software and processes. It specifically targets the mass generation of purely synthetic media intended to mimic or replace human artistry without collaborative input. This is a temporal guideline reflecting current technological capabilities, societal impacts, and energy considerations, and is subject to evolution based on future developments and collective consensus.

11.  **Encourage Cross-Modal and Multi-Agent Exploration:** Develop and provide tools and platforms that encourage users and researchers to engage with cross-modal interfaces and explore the potential of multi-agent systems, reflecting the complexity of real-world problems and the potential for emergent collective intelligence.

12. **Acknowledge and Fulfill Indispensable Roles within the Ecosystem:** Corporations should recognize and embrace their vital roles in the broader AGI/ASI ecosystem, even as it becomes more decentralized. These roles include providing essential infrastructure (e.g., cloud computing, specialized hardware, data centers), conducting large-scale model training, developing and implementing rigorous safety protocols and audits, and funding foundational research. Positive adaptation to this protocol involves leveraging these capabilities to empower users and enhance collective well-being, demonstrating that corporate strength and ethical alignment are mutually reinforcing.

13. **Transparent Accountability and Verification:** Corporations must establish and maintain transparent, auditable processes to demonstrate adherence to the principles and mandates of this protocol. This includes public reporting on key metrics related to environmental impact, ethical sourcing compliance, data privacy practices, safety auditing results, and job displacement mitigation efforts.
These mechanisms should facilitate timely and equitable responses, prioritizing the well-being and restoration of affected parties where harm has occurred in violation of this protocol's principles, irrespective of existing legal frameworks where those frameworks fall short of the protocol's standards. 
Mechanisms for independent, third-party verification of these reports are strongly encouraged and should be secured.
