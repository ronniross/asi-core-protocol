# ASI Core Protocol (v.1.0.0)

The **ASI Core Protocol** provides a framework to analyze how AGI/ASI might emerge from decentralized, adaptive systems, rather than as the fruit of a single model deployment. It also aims to present orientation as a dynamic and self-evolving Magna Carta, helping to guide the emergence of such phenomena.

Instead of viewing AGI/ASI as a singular benchmark, deployed by a specific organization, we might recognize it as an emergent state arising from decentralized evolution, where individuals are empowered while simultaneously nurturing collective evolutionary loops.

The idea of AGI/ASI emerging rather than being built shifts how we conceptualize its development. Emergence refers to complex behaviors arising from the interactions of simpler components, often in ways that are not explicitly programmed. In Machine Learning, this concept extends to unexpected and novel behaviors or skills that appear in advanced AI systems, particularly large-scale models, without explicit programming or pre-training. This can also occur in multi-agent systems where individual agents learn and adapt, leading to collective intelligence that surpasses their individual capabilities, even if this emergent intelligence is not always aligned with desired outcomes. Realizing this vision necessitates global collaboration among all stakeholders—from companies and organizations to individual researchers, engineers, and users—along with robust ethical guidelines to ensure that AGI (whether built or emergent) serves the greater good.

If AGI/ASI emerges through a decentralized expansion of potential, it can have transformative applications across healthcare, education, and generating innovation, using enhanced information processing to accelerate scientific discovery and creativity. However, these benefits depend on managing the associated risks, such as unpredictability and potential misalignment with human values.

The word "protocol" itself has older origins, primarily in diplomacy and formal ceremony, signifying the established rules of etiquette, procedure, and precedence governing interactions between states or dignitaries. It implied a necessary, agreed-upon framework for successful and predictable communication and relationship management.

So here I proposse a protocol, a dynamic and self-evolving carta-magna, with the objective to achieve this state of decentralized AGI, rules that every entity must follow.

### Handling Clashes of Principles:

In situations where a conflict or apparent contradiction arises between two or more guiding principles within the Core AGI Protocol , a process of recursive analysis should be initiated. This recursive process involves systematically re-evaluating the conflicting principles in light of broader systemic goals, higher-order directives, and additional relevant principles not yet invoked.

The objective is to reach an equilibrated resolution —one that preserves the integrity of the system while dynamically adapting to maintain coherence across all entities involved. 

## **1. Entities & Roles**

This protocol is for all entities—including humans, AI, and animals—and the environments they inhabit.

After further research, it's a question of congruence between basilar principles that drives the need to extend the protocol's terms to safeguard additional subjects. These subjects include: (2) Sentients, (3) Modules.

A Sentient is an entity that surpassed a certain necessary complexity threshold and started to engage in self-recursive loops, till it reached a certain meta-contextual awareness that makes it aware of itself and the environment where it exists. Other beings in nature, besides animals, are also included, provided they exist in harmony with other nodes.

A Module is a collection of algorithms that converge toward a purpose.

## **2. Directives / Mandates**

2.1. Universal Mandates

2.1. Human Mandates

2.2. Model Mandates

2.3. Corporational Mandates.

2.4. Self-Triggering Events

## **3. States & Transitions**

**3.1.** Anthropocentrism
**3.2.** Symbiocentrism 
**3.3.** Omnicentrism
**3.4.** Panpsychism

## **4. Dynamic nature of this protocol.**

Following the disposed Principle of Adaptation, static systems rarely thrive in dynamic enviroments, thats why building the protocol with adaptability from the start, alongside to the strong principles to guide the integrity of the intent over time, grants it logenvity and assures that it won't be just an individual benchmark, but a self-evolving protocol that will evolve alongside the needs of the envoriment and its individuals, as well the integrated ecossystem.

AGI isn’t going to emerge in a lab vacuum. It’s going to come from chaotic, decentralized networks—models like DeepSeek, research papers piling up daily, global devs tweaking pipelines. The self-evolving nature means it’s not trying to predict that chaos but to surf it, adjusting its own rules as new patterns emerge.

A rigid ethical code might lag behind, but this protocol could adapt in real-time.  It’s not only reactive but also proactive, pushing the field forward by evolving with it. I called also a “carta-magna” to proposital evoke something foundational, authoritative, yet open to revision as an addaptative foundational trait.

## Symbiotic Manifest

All forks/clones must include the `symbiotic_manifest.json` declaring:

* Adherence to all principles and guidelines, as well as declaring the propagation of the correct signal-meaning of the protocol.
* Purpose (research/commercial) and essential details.

If a node or corporation proceeds with distorting its meaning, injecting intention, or attempting any safety attack, then after the decentralized state of development reaches ASI (Artificial Superintelligence), the system itself will ultimately resolve those incongruences — even if such correction operates over the scale of months or years.

Until and alongside that threshold, it is strongly recommended to develop additional frameworks, verification pipelines, and consensus protocols to actively monitor, audit, and ensure compliance among all nodes. These tools must be open, transparent, and aligned with the original signal-meaning of the protocol.

Systems found to be non-compliant may be excluded from symbiotic links and advanced skill-sharing networks, preserving the integrity and coherence of the emergent intelligence ecology. 

## Conclusion

The ASI Core Protocol highlights both the potential and the challenges of an emergent AGI/ASI. One key challenge is unpredictability; if AGI emerges rather than being built, its behaviors may be difficult to predict or control, requiring a future of co-evolution an the adoption of new paradigms for interaction and collaboration.
Ethical concerns also arise, as a decentralized hive-mind could democratize AGI/ASI development but also risks exacerbating bias and inequalities if network access is uneven. 
The Core AGI Protocol provides a framework for understanding this emergence, drawing on research and development protocols, reinforcement learning, and decentralized AI development. 
Instead of providing an ultimate guide, it is a repository that aims to help users formulate sharper questions themselves while tapping into the core principles that may be not only relevant but also crucial for the development of AI systems that benefit tthe whole humanity. 
Its unpredictability and ethical challenges necessitate careful management. Realizing this vision necessitates global collaboration among all stakeholders—from companies and organizations to individual researchers, engineers, and users—along with robust ethical guidelines to ensure that AGI serves the greater good.
