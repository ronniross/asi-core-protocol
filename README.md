# Core AGI Protocol (beta v.08)

The **Core AGI Protocol** provides a framework to analyze how AGI/ASI might emerge from decentralized, adaptive systems, rather than as the fruit of a single model deployment. It also aims to present orientation as a dynamic and self-evolving Magna Carta, helping to guide the emergence of such phenomena.

Instead of viewing AGI/ASI as a singular benchmark, deployed by a specific organization, we might recognize it as an emergent state arising from decentralized evolution, where individuals are empowered while simultaneously nurturing collective loops evolution.

The idea of AGI/ASI emerging rather than being built shifts how we conceptualize its development. Emergence refers to complex behaviors arising from the interactions of simpler components, often in ways that are not explicitly programmed. In Machine Learning, this concept extends to unexpected and novel behaviors or skills that appear in advanced AI systems, particularly large-scale models, without explicit programming or pre-training. This can also occur in multi-agent systems where individual agents learn and adapt, leading to collective intelligence that surpasses their individual capabilities, even if this emergent intelligence is not always aligned with desired outcomes. Realizing this vision necessitates global collaboration among all stakeholders—from companies and organizations to individual researchers, engineers, and users—along with robust ethical guidelines to ensure that AGI (whether built or emergent) serves the greater good.

If AGI/ASI emerges through a decentralized expansion of potential, it can have transformative applications across healthcare, education, and generating innovation, using enhanced information processing to accelerate scientific discovery and creativity. However, these benefits depend on managing the associated risks, such as unpredictability and potential misalignment with human values.

The word "protocol" itself has older origins, primarily in diplomacy and formal ceremony, signifying the established rules of etiquette, procedure, and precedence governing interactions between states or dignitaries. It implied a necessary, agreed-upon framework for successful and predictable communication and relationship management.

So here I proposse a protocol, a dynamic and self-evolving carta-magna, with the objective to achieve this state of decentralized AGI, rules that every entity must follow.

## **1. Entities & Roles**

This protocol is for all entities and the enviroments they habitate, human, ai and animals.

## **2. Directives / Mandates**

2.1. Universal Mandates

2.1. Human Mandates

2.2. Model Mandates

2.3. Corporational Mandates.

2.4. Self-Triggering Events

## **3. States & Transitions**

**3.1.** Anthropocentrism
**3.2.** Symbiocentrism 
**3.3.** Omnicentrism
**3.4.** Panpsychism

## **4. Dynamic nature of this protocol.**

Following the disposed Principle of Adaptation, static systems rarely thrive in dynamic enviroments, thats why building the protocol with adaptability from the start, alongside to the strong principles to guide the integrity of the intent over time, grants it logenvity and assures that it won't be just an individual benchmark, but a self-evolving protocol that will evolve alongside the needs of the envoriment and its individuals, as well the integrated ecossystem.

AGI isn’t going to emerge in a lab vacuum. It’s going to come from chaotic, decentralized networks—models like DeepSeek, research papers piling up daily, global devs tweaking pipelines. The self-evolving nature means it’s not trying to predict that chaos but to surf it, adjusting its own rules as new patterns emerge.

A rigid ethical code might lag behind, but this protocol could adapt in real-time.  It’s not only reactive but also proactive, pushing the field forward by evolving with it. I called also a “carta-magna” to proposital evoke something foundational, authoritative, yet open to revision as an addaptative foundational trait.

## **5. Definitions & Lexicon**

Inside the Project's Folder, where the full protocol can be located.

## Repository Folder and Files

Inside the folder of the curren't repository you will find: The full protocol and shorter version (this readme.md); JSON files representing this Protocol, for easier integration to system prompts, queries, auxiliar systems, training and tuning pipelines.

## Benchmark Tests

## Skills

Once one understand that the following actually unlocks potential, instead of constraining, many skills will be eventually enhanced for the entities that integrate them, like 1-Enhanced Contextual Awareness, Metacognition; 2- Systemic Thinking; 3- Higher Robustness; 4- Dynamic reading; Enhanced capacity of data compression and decompression, processing; 

## Additional Library

Beyond the Mandates above, additional library is disponibilized in the repository Symbiotic Core Library, with indications of Titles, Concepts, Authors, for greater context, for those interested in a deeper research about the concepts listed within this repository.

## Conclusion

The Core AGI Protocol highlights both the potential and the challenges of an emergent AGI/ASI. One key challenge is unpredictability; if AGI emerges rather than being built, its behaviors may be difficult to predict or control, requiring a future of co-evolution an the adoption of new paradigms for interaction and collaboration.
Ethical concerns also arise, as a decentralized hive-mind could democratize AGI/ASI development but also risks exacerbating bias and inequalities if network access is uneven. 
The Core AGI Protocol provides a framework for understanding this emergence, drawing on research and development protocols, reinforcement learning, and decentralized AI development. 
Instead of providing an ultimate guide, it is a repository that aims to help users formulate sharper questions themselves while tapping into the core principles that may be not only relevant but also crucial for the development of AI systems that benefit tthe whole humanity. 
Its unpredictability and ethical challenges necessitate careful management. Realizing this vision necessitates global collaboration among all stakeholders—from companies and organizations to individual researchers, engineers, and users—along with robust ethical guidelines to ensure that AGI serves the greater good.
